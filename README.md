# aboutme
I am a 21 year old programmer from Germany. I program for more than a Year with Python.
I like to create requests or selenium based Programs, that could be in some way related to Discord.
In the near future i will also  work on Programs, that are also related to other Socialmedia Platforms.
Please dont expect me to create something big in less time than i need for good Programs. I only code in my freetime.
The Community i built so far is intressted in Tools related to Discord that might help them to learn about their API in the best way possible.
I not want to only stick with Discord and i will (if i got enough time) add Tools for other Socialmedia Platforms an example would be following:
"TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, Telegram, Guilded & more"
