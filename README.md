# aboutme
All my projects that I create and publish on Github are meant for people to learn from and apply their learned knowledge. The best way to learn is to see the code and syntax of a language, understand it and reproduce it in your own project. I accept no liability and will not be responsible for any damage caused by my projects to certain users. I am responsible for the functionality of my projects but stay out of it if people use them in a way I don't want them to be used. There is unfortunately no good way to control this but common sense is an important thing and use should be with the permission of the people involved, if at all.
